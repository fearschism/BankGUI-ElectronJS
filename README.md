# BankGUI-ElectronJS
Building my BankGUI(java edition) into javaScript from scratch.
##this project is heavy on jquery. that's why its 70%+ html

Gonna include:
- Login Page(User/Client, and Admin)
- Admin Dashboard includes(Add clients, Manage Balances, Transfers, Add Admins)
- User Dashboard includes(Edit account, Trasfer, Withdraw/deposit, and invest(Stockmarket-sim))

- the app is gonna be offline, it's only gonna use your localhost for the localstorage to work.
- windows defender or your antivirus software might detect this as a virus, the reason why is that it's a false alarm or a misunderstanding from the system.
- you can run this, it includes no viruses nor malwares.
